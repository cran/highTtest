Description: Implements the method developed by Cao and Kosorok (2011) for the 
    significance analysis of thousands of features in high-dimensional 
    biological studies. It is an asymptotically valid data-driven procedure 
    to find critical values for rejection regions controlling the 
    k-familywise error rate, false discovery rate, and the tail probability 
    of false discovery proportion.
