\title{
Simultaneous critical values for t-tests in very high dimensions}

\description{
Implements the method developed by Cao and Kosorok (2011) for the significance 
analysis of thousands of features in high-dimensional biological studies. 
It is an asymptotically valid data-driven procedure to find critical values 
for rejection regions controlling the k-familywise error rate, false discovery 
rate, and the tail probability of false discovery proportion.}

\usage{
highTtest(dataSet1, dataSet2, gammas, compare = "BOTH", cSequence = NULL, 
tSequence = NULL)
}

\arguments{
  \item{dataSet1 }{data.frame or matrix containing the dataset for subset 1
                   for the two-sample t-test.}
  \item{dataSet2 }{data.frame or matrix containing the dataset for subset 2
                   for the two-sample t-test.}
  \item{gammas   }{vector of significance levels at which feature 
                   significance is to be determined.}
  \item{compare  }{one of ("ST", "BH", "Both", "None"). 
                   In addition to the Cao-Kosorok method, 
                   obtain feature significance indicators using
                   the Storey-Tibshirani method (ST) 
                   (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003),
                   the Benjamini-Hochberg method (BH), 
                   (Benjamini andHochberg, 1995),
                   "both" the ST and the BH methods, or 
                   do not consider alternative methods (none).}
  \item{cSequence}{A vector specifying the values of c to be considered
                   in estimating the proportion of alternative hypotheses. 
                   If no vector is provided, a default of 
                   seq(0.01,6,0.01) is used. See Section 2.3 of
                   Cao and Kosorok (2011) for more information.}
  \item{tSequence}{A vector specifying the search space for the critical 
                   t value. If no vector is provided, a default of 
                   seq(0.01,6,0.01) is used.}

\details{
The Storey-Tibshirani (2003), ST, method implemented in \pkg{highTtest} is
adapted from the implementation written by Alan Dabney and John D. Storey and 
available from 

http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/qvalue.html. 

The comparison capability is included only for convenience and reproducibility 
of the original manuscript. For a complete analysis based on the ST method, 
the user is referred to the \pkg{qvalue} package available through the
bioconductor archive.

The following methods retrieve individual results from a highTtest
object, x: 

    \code{BH(x)}: 
              Retrieves a matrix of logical values. The
              rows correspond to features, the columns to levels
              of significance. Matrix elements are TRUE if feature
              was determined to be significant by the Benjamini-Hochberg
              (1995) method.

    \code{CK(x)}: 
              Retrieves a matrix of logical values. The
              rows correspond to features, the columns to levels
              of significance. Matrix elements are TRUE if feature
              was determined to be significant by the Cao-Kosorok
              (2011) method.

    \code{pi_alt(x)}: Retrieves the
        estimated proportion of alternative hypotheses
        obtained by the Cao-Kosorok (2011) method. 

    \code{pvalue(x)}: Retrieves the
        vector of p-values calculated using the
                       two-sample t-statistic. 

    \code{ST(x)}:  
              Retrieves a matrix of logical values. The
              rows correspond to features, the columns to levels
              of significance. Matrix elements are TRUE if feature
              was determined to be significant by the Storey-Tibshirani
             (2003) method. 



A simple x-y plot comparing the number of significant
features as a function of the level significance level
can be generated using

    \code{plot(x,...)}: Generates a plot
        of the number of significant features as a function of the
        level of significance as calculated for each method (CK,BH, and/or
         ST). Additional plot controls can be passed through the ellipsis.

When comparisons to the ST and BH methods are requested, Venn diagrams
can be generated using provided that package colorfulVennPlot is
installed.

    \code{vennD(x, gamma, ...)}: Generates 
        two- and three-dimensional Venn diagrams comparing the
        features selected by each method. Implements methods of
        package \pkg{colorfulVennPlot}. In addition to the \code{highTtest}
        object, the level of significance, \code{gamma}, must
        also be provided. Most control argument of the
        \pkg{colorfulVennPlot} package can be passed through the ellipsis.
